So, here we are. Presenting: **[the PULLDOG page â†’](https://pulldog.live)**

On the pulldog page, **anything goes**. This is a public GitHub repository, and I'll merge any pull request you make. But there are some ground rules:

## Rules!

1. Do not change or add any other CA on this page
1. No spamming, advertising, or simply deleting other people's work
1. No potential security issues, like random third-party scripts
1. Please try not to hide/move this head section or the contributors section below :)
